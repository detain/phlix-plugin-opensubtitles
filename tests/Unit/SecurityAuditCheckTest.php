/**
 * S246 — behaviour of `scripts/security-audit-check.php`, by execution.
 *
 * Lane token: S440OPENSUBTITILESGUARDY7C3.
 *
 * ## The defect these tests pin shut
 *
 * This repository had **no security audit gate at all**: nothing in CI ever
 * asked whether a locked dependency carried a published advisory.
 *
 * On 2026-08-06 CVE-2026-67434 (HIGH, OS command injection) landed against
 * `squizlabs/php_codesniffer`. Only phlix-server went red, because only
 * phlix-server audited its development dependencies. A green that cannot go red
 * is not evidence.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why each half exists
 *
 *  1. **The dev half is really audited.** {@see testAnAdvisoryAgainstADevelopmentDependencyBlocks()}
 *     is the direct regression test: a `require-dev` advisory must exit 1 and be
 *     labelled `[require-dev]` so the reader can still see the scope.
 *  2. **`--no-dev` cannot appear.** The audit flags are a declared constant,
 *     read here rather than pattern-matched out of prose, and the workflow is
 *     parsed with its comments stripped — the new job carries a comment naming
 *     the offending flag, and a detector that matches its own documentation is
 *     not a detector.
 *  3. **The gate cannot be neutered.** The audit job must carry no
 *     `continue-on-error` and no `if:` condition — the job slice runs to
 *     end-of-file, so step-level flags are caught too — and the workflow must
 *     still run on `pull_request`.
 *  4. **The corpus is stated and floored.** A gate that ran and inspected zero
 *     packages is the commonest false pass in this estate and looks exactly like
 *     a clean run, so the printed size is checked against an independent count,
 *     and both floors are driven to failure.
 *  5. **Cannot-measure fails.** Missing lock, unparseable lock, missing payload,
 *     empty payload, unparseable payload, unrecognised payload shape and an
 *     unreachable advisory repository each exit 1 rather than passing.
 *  6. **The blocking/advisory split holds.** Abandonment and config-ignored
 *     advisories are loud but non-blocking; a real advisory blocks even when
 *     they are present, so the advisory half cannot become decorative.
 *  7. **The command cannot be neutered at the shell.** The audit step's single
 *     `run:` line is pinned by EQUALITY to the bare gate invocation — `|| true`
 *     keeps every containment check green while making the step always succeed
 *     (C2-review hole H1), so containment is not enough.
 *  8. **The flags cannot be bypassed at the spawn.** The process call that runs
 *     `composer audit` must take its argv from the AUDIT_ARGUMENTS constant,
 *     and the literal `'audit'` must occur nowhere else in the script — an
 *     inline argv would leave the constant, and every assertion reading it,
 *     intact while auditing a different command (C2-review hole H2).
 *
 * ## 2026-10-07 hardening port (owner-ratified, S440 census closure)
 *
 * The reference guard (phlix-plugin-sample-theme 856900e) was hardened against
 * two C2-review holes this suite did not yet cover: the audit run line was
 * checked only by CONTAINMENT — appending `|| true` kept every check green
 * (hole H1) — and nothing pinned the composer spawn site to the AUDIT_ARGUMENTS
 * constant, so an inline argv could audit a different command while every
 * flag assertion reading the constant stayed green (hole H2). Items 7 and 8,
 * {@see testTheAuditRunLineIsTheBareGateInvocation()} and
 * {@see testTheComposerAuditSpawnBuildsItsArgvFromTheConstant()}, are ported
 * byte-identical from the hardened template, together with the lane-token and
 * committed-lock markers for parity. This repository's gate script is
 * token-identical to the reference family and its audit-job workflow slice is
 * md5-identical, so no assertion needed bending to fit — verified by execution
 * before commit.
